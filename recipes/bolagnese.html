    <h3>Description:</h3>
    </p>

    <p><strong> Bolognese sauce is a classic Italian sauce for pasta made with ground meat such as beef or pork. It's slow cooked with a
    soffritto of onions, carrots, and celery, tomatoes, and milk to give it a creamy texture.
    Pronounced "bow-luh-nez," the sauce comes from the Bologna region of Italy, hence the name. Given the cultural history
    of this sauce, there are many variations, but they all seem to follow a basic structure of ground meat, a soffritto, a
    bit of tomato, some milk, and long, slow cooking.
